## Description

E-commerce Shopping Platform (with Ads)

This web app mimics an online shopping platform (just like Amazon and eBay) where the user could register as either a buyer or a seller.
For sellers, they can post products with a price; for buyers, they can add their favorite items into the shopping cart. Furthermore, this 
web app also introduces the "Ads" system where we mimic the Google Ads Platform to have a bunch of advertisers and ads. They can provide 
their budget and ads' bid and we calculate the best score ad the show it to the user.
